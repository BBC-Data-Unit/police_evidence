Thousands of criminal cases - including some of the most serious violent and sexual offences - are collapsing every year because of lost, damaged or missing evidence, the BBC Shared Data Unit reported in June, 2025.

More than 30,000 prosecutions in England and Wales collapsed between October 2020 and September 2024, data from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) revealed.

They included 70 homicides and more than 550 sexual offences.

Police chiefs said not all the cases relate to lost evidence and the figures include situations where officers may not be able to find an expert witness or get a medical statement.

However, it followed a series of damning reports about how police forces are storing evidence.

A Home Office spokesperson said: "We always expect forces to adhere to the National Police Chiefs' Council's (NPCC) guidance on storage and retention of evidence."

A leading criminologist says the increase was largely "a resourcing issue" brought about by cuts to police forces throughout the 2010s.

And ex-police officers told the BBC it was unsurprising and the amount of evidence they deal with is "overwhelming".

When police forces build cases around defendants they hand a file to the CPS.

But when the CPS cannot proceed to trial because police do not have the necessary evidence needed to secure a conviction - they record it in their data as an "E72".

The BBC, alongside the University of Leicester, managed to obtain Freedom of Information (FOI) requests showing the number of E72s recorded between 2020 and 2024 at police forces in England and Wales.

They can include:

* Physical evidence - including forensic evidence - being lost, damaged or contaminated during storage

* Digital evidence, such as victim interview footage or body camera footage, being lost

* Witness statements or pathology reports not being made available by police

* Key evidence not gathered from the crime scene

* The figures obtained by the BBC do not break down why cases have collapsed.

However, the data does suggest the number of cases recorded as an E72 are increasing, with a higher proportion of prosecutions failing to result in a conviction because of lost or missing evidence each year.

In 2020, a total of 7,484 prosecutions collapsed because of lost, missing or damaged evidence. In 2024, that had risen by 9%, to 8,180.

## Methodology

We sent a Freedom of Information request to the CPS asking for a monthly tally of all collapsed cases with the E72 code between October 2022 and September 2024, broken down by crime type and police force.

We also managed to obtain data behind an earlier study, the University of Leicester’s ‘You don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it's gone’: Police retention of investigative materials, which shows the number of E72s recorded in the two years prior to 2022. This meant we could show the national trend over the past four years alongside our local police force data for the last two years.

## Get the Data

We created this {background briefing pack}[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1INRbHTo7BICaP6KT-8xDbOpVEBnwG20chQ9vzYlMvaE/edit?usp=sharing] with a detailed background, a full rundown of our findings and interviws and rights of responses.

And we shared this spreadsheet showing how many prosecution cases were dropped due to lost or missing evidence at every police force in England and Wales between October 2022 and September 2024 and how many of those related to sexual offences and to homicide. Please note: each data point refers to an individual defendant.

It also shows how many prosecutions occurred in total during that time to put those figures in context. Please note that local data was only available between 2022 and 2024- though we obtained national figures stretching back to 2020.

This pack contained quotes from evidence retention expert professor Carole McCartney as well as a right of response from the National Police Chief’s Council.
